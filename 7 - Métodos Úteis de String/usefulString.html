        // includes()
        // Sometimes you'll want to find if a smaller string is present inside a larger one (we generally say if a substring is present inside a string). This can be done using the 'includes()' method, which takes a single parameter — the substring you want to search for.
        const browserType = "mozilla";

        if (browserType.includes("zilla")) {
            console.log("Found zilla!");
        } else {
            console.log("No zilla here!");
        }

        // Often you'll want to know if a string starts or ends with a particular substring. This is a common enough need that there are two special methods for this: 'startsWith()' and 'endsWith()';
        browserType = "mozilla";

        // startsWith()
        if (browserType.startsWith("zilla")) {
            console.log("Found zilla!");
        } else {
            console.log("No zilla here!");
        }

        //endsWith()
        if (browserType.endsWith("zilla")) {
            console.log("Found zilla!");
        } else {
            console.log("No zilla here!");
        }


        // You can find the position of a substring inside a larger string using the 'indexOf()' method. This method 'takes two parameters' – the substring that you want to search for, and an optional parameter that specifies the starting point of the search.
        const tagline = "MDN - Resources for developers, by developers";
        console.log(tagline.indexOf("developers")); // 20

        // Starting at 0, if you count the number of characters (including the whitespace) from the beginning of the string, the first occurrence of the substring "developers" is at index 20.
        console.log(tagline.indexOf("x")); // -1

        // slice() method
        browserType = "mozilla";
        console.log(borwserType.slice(1,4 + 1)); // "ozi"

        // If you know that you want to extract all of the remaining characters in a string after a certain character, you don't have to include the second parameter. Instead, you only need to include the character position from where you want to extract the remaining characters in a string. Try the following:
        browserType.slice(2); // return "zilla"

        // The string methods toLowerCase() and toUpperCase() take a string and convert all the characters to lower- or uppercase, respectively.
        const radData = "My NaMe Is MuD";
        console.log(radData.toUpperCase()); // MY NAME IS MUD
        console.log(radData.toLowerCase()); // my name is mud
