// their explanation was not that accurate as I expected. As u can see, it is very different compared to the original one. And thats was how I understand that should be done.
// the 'only thing' that don't work in my code is the 'click' thing, so my text dont show on the page... Well, maybe i don't really understood everuthing, but I think that i'm progressing on this.
