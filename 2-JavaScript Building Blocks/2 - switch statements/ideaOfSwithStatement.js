//  switch statements are your friend â€” they take a single expression/value as an input, and then look through several choices until they find one that matches that value, executing the corresponding code that goes along with it. Here's some more pseudocode, to give you an idea:
switch (expression) {
    case choice:
        // run  this code
        break;

    case choice2:
        //run this code
        break;
    
    // include as many  cases  as u like 

    default:
        // actually, just run this code
        break;
}
